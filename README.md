# Predicting_Ratings

In the Over-The-Top video streaming industry, competition is fierce as ever. To maintain a prominent position in this field, marketing, and personalized marketing, is increasingly more popular. In this thesis, the effect of a new hybrid feature augmentation model is tested, aiming to improve personalized marketing through improved rating classification. The output of different clustering algorithms (K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN clusering) are used as input for multiple supervised learning algorithms (Random Forest, Extreme Gradient Boosting). Unfortunately, this did not result in higher performance of the models. Even though the outcome was not as positive as hoped, this research still contributes to literature by adding knowledge about hybrid models. Societally, this research contributes to video streaming services, indicating this is not a way they should be spending their funds.
