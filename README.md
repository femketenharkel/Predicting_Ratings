**Abstract**: The over-the-top (OTT) video streaming industry is as competi- tive as ever and requires advanced personalized marketing strategies to maintain user engagement and satisfaction. Sophisticated rec- ommendation systems can significantly improve user experience by providing accurate and personalized content suggestions. This is of utmost importance to streaming services, as better recommendations can lead to efficient resource allocation, targeted marketing efforts, and ultimately to higher customer lifetime value. This thesis explores a new feature augmentation model that investigates the effectiveness of leveraging clustering algorithms (K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) as input for different supervised learning algo- rithms (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting) to improve accuracy in rating classification. This research aimed to contribute to the improved understanding of hybrid models in recommendation systems, using the MovieLens-1M dataset. The robustness of this model was ensured with a combination of the hold-out approach and Nested Cross-Validation. Extreme Gradient Boosting performed best with an accuracy of 0.44 and an F1-score of 0.43. This study demonstrates that, while the proposed hybrid models did not out- perform baseline models, they still provide helpful information on using supervised learning clustering algorithms for recommendation systems. The research did not find evidence that this hybrid model is inherently flawed. The models in this thesis pave the way for future research. To enhance model performance further, it is essential to address current limitations by employing advanced computational techniques.
