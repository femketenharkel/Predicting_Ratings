**Abstract**: The over-the-top (OTT) video streaming industry is as competitive as ever and requires advanced personalized marketing strategies to maintain user engagement and satisfaction. This thesis explores the effectiveness of leveraging clustering algorithms (K-Means clustering, Hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) as input for different supervised learning algorithms (Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting) to improve rating classification in recommendation systems. The study uses the MovieLens-1M dataset and employs a hybrid feature augmentation model to enhance recommendation accuracy. The robustness of the model is ensured with a combination of the hold-out approach and Nested Cross-Validation. This research contributes to understanding hybrid models in recommendation systems by highlighting the challenges and opportunities. Improved recommendation systems can significantly enhance user experience by providing more accurate and personalized content suggestions, increasing user satisfaction and retention. For streaming services, better recommendations can lead to more efficient resource allocation, targeted marketing efforts, and ultimately, higher customer lifetime value. These improvements not only benefit the service providers but also contribute to a more engaging and satisfying user experience, fostering a sustainable and competitive market environment. The findings indicate that while the proposed hybrid models did not outperform baseline models, they provide helpful insights into the use of clustering algorithms with supervised learning for recommendation systems. The models in this thesis pave the way for future research to optimize recommendation systems, addressing current limitations and leveraging advanced computational techniques to achieve better performance.
